' User relationships with their workspaces
User1 -[#green,bold]-> User1Workspace: owns
User2 -[#green,bold]-> User2Workspace: owns
User3 -[#green,bold]-> User3Workspace: owns

' Cross-user access relationships
User1 -[#blue]-> User3Workspace: has editor access
User2 -[#purple]-> User1Workspace: has admin access
User3 -[#gray]-> User1Workspace: has view access
User3 -[#blue]-> User2Workspace: has editor access

' GitOps deployments to clusters
GitRepo1_1 -[#orange]-> ClusterA1: deploys to
GitRepo1_2 -[#orange]-> ClusterB1: deploys to
GitRepo2_1 -[#orange]-> ClusterC2: deploys to
GitRepo2_2 -[#orange]-> ClusterC2: deploys to
GitRepo2_3 -[#orange]-> ClusterC2: deploys to
GitRepo3_1 -[#orange]-> ClusterD3: deploys to
GitRepo3_1 -[#orange]-> ClusterE3: deploys to

note bottom: Implements:\n- Automatic Fleet Workspace creation per user\n- Role-based access across workspaces\n- GitOps-based deployments to K8s clusters\n- CRD for provisioning clusters
